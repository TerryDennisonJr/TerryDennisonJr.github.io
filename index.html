      <p>
        Aspiring Software Developer professional educated in multiple coding languages through college education. I hate
        to sound cliche but is
        it not cool what software can create? Ever since I got my first game
        system (Nintendo!) I wanted to know how it worked behind the scenes.
        That curiousity has led me to pursure my education in the field and
        yearning to learn more about software development.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other than coding(of course!), I like to spend my free time hanging
        out with my pets, watching sports, and playing video games. Huge fan
        of Squaresoft /Square Enix Final Fantasy Series, and NBA 2K. I have
        also been reading more as I have always been a fan of the library
        (so much free stuff!).
